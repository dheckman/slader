## Slader

This small application uses ReactJS to render a webpage that parses data from a JSON file and displays it in a paginated table. 

----------------------------------------

### Technology

I decided to use React and React Table for a few different reasons when building this page. I always like to build my projects under the assumption that they would fit into a larger application, so I used technologies that scale well and are well documented and supported. I also converted the CSV file into a JSON format, as I find it much easier to parse and work with.

### To install and run

```sh
$ git clone <url>
$ cd to repo
$ npm install
$ yarn start
# or 
$ npm start
This will start up a dev server and open a page at http://localhost:8000
```
